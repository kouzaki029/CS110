                    This course encompasses topics such as HTML, CSS, an introduction to JavaScript, and the creation
                    of websites.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Prerequisites:</u></b> Successful completion of MAT 100 or an equivalent math placement score.
                    Additionally, a fundamental understanding of computer operations is required, including skills
                    such as copy and paste functions, proficiency in using a text editor, navigating a web browser,
                    familiarity with folder management, uploading and downloading files, and the ability to zip and
                    unzip files. Some students may also need to install supplementary software, such as JetBrains'
                    WebStorm for HTML file development and an image-editing software like Paint.NET.

                    <br>
                    <b><u>Description:</u></b> This course adopts a problem-solving oriented methodology to acquaint students with
                    the diverse facets of website production. Topics covered include requirements elicitation and
                    analysis, design specifications, handling of images, videos, audio, HTML, CSS, and the application
                    of mathematical/logical programming through a scripting language like JavaScript. Engaging in
                    interactive, hands-on sessions, students will have the opportunity to build a website that fulfills
                    a predefined set of requirements. The successful completion of this course meets General Education
                    requirements for Computer Science and Quantitative Reasoning.

                    <b><u>Objectives:</u></b><br>
                    • Apply a standard problem-solving approach to website design and implementation.<br>
                    • Discuss the fundamental components of the website production process, including requirements elicitation and analysis, design specifications, implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as outcome evaluation.<br>
                    • Demonstrate the ability to construct a moderately complex website featuring text, images, audio, video, and JavaScript functions.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b><u>Quantitative Reasoning Learning Outcomes:</u></b><br>
                    • Make informed judgments and draw conclusions about quantitative information, recognizing its limitations.<br>
                    • Apply a stepwise problem-solving methodology to analyze quantitative problems, identifying knowns, unknowns, and requirements.<br>
                    • Use quantitative principles, theories, and methods to solve real-world problems.<br>
                    • Solve numerical problems by creating appropriate sets of equations and translating them into algorithmic solutions, including error checking, algebraic computations, numerical data analysis, and 2D graphics.<br>
                    • Apply computational procedures to solve problems effectively.<br>
                    • Utilize a scripting language, such as JavaScript, to design and implement functions based on algorithmic solutions to mathematical and logical problems for incorporation into webpages.<br>
                    • Explain quantitative information presented in textual, visual, or notational forms.<br>
                    • Produce various charts, graphs, tables, etc., based on algorithmic solutions to numerical problems.<br>
                    • Present quantitative information in clear and appropriate forms.<br>
                    • Integrate various charts, graphs, tables, etc., derived from algorithmic solutions to numerical problems into a website's design.<br>
